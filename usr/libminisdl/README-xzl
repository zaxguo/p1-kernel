// xzl: from NJU project. the choice of SDL interfaces seems good. 
// the plan is to implement the same SDL interface atop our kernel, 
// then build/port apps atop the SDL interface

// in impl, we refer back to SDL API defs. 

// these lib depends on libc (in our case, newlib). not xv6's ulib 

doom-sdl may require some SDL APIs not impelmented here, but the mapping 
should be easy. 


the API of update texture, then update rendering target with texture ....
results in additional buffering. why not direct rendering to the render target???

but that's how doom is written and how API works. so ok as of now.
